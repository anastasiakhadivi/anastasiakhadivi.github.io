				<p>In PSYCHO NYMPH EXILE by artists Porpentine Charity Heartscape, Neotenomie, and Sloane, PTSD is a color-coded energy source that props up the universe; people vacation in dying parallel dimensions; and state IDs are tarot decks emanating from their psyches. The user pieces this world together with fragments that are distributed across various mediums, including an online hypertext work, a booklet, and stickers.</p>

				<p>The project depicts the experience of PTSD as a visceral physical substance, not an invisible, abstract force. According to Heartscape, whose previous work has often used hypertext to reimagine social reality, the work proposes a &ldquo;trauma revolution to follow the sexual revolution,&rdquo; in which a massive repressed energy field might be unleashed.</p>

				<p>PSYCHO NYMPH EXILE was commissioned by Rhizome and is copresented by Rhizome and the New Museum as part of the series<br> First Look: New Art Online.</p>
