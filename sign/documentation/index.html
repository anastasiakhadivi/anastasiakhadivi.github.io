			<p>The New Museum in NYC is committed to new art and new ideas. They host a series of online exhibitions that can be viewed at home. They have chosen not to make these online exhibits part of their museum. For this project, I envisioned this digital sign to take up a wall within the museum.

Using iframes, I created viewports into the online exhibits that the New Museum is offering. </p>

			<p>I started this with the idea that their online exhibits should also live within in the museum for their guests to see and interact with. Starting out rather boring, the inital designs just featured the iframe and wall text- mirroring a museums exhibitions but not responding to The New Museum itself.  </p>

			<p>I believe with the use of background color and audio, this project feel much more New Museum than it originally started as.</p>

<!-- 			<p>In another iteration of this project, I tried a pulsing effect to represent the ‘holding breath’ stage  of the cycle. This iteration was created to have a continuous movement, but in doing so it moved away from my original idea. I tested both iterations on multiple people, all of which were confused by when to inhale and exhale, which drew me back to my original idea. </p> -->
