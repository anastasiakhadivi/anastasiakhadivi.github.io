				<p>On April 19, 2014, Amalia Ulman uploaded an image to her Instagram account of the words “Part I” in black serifed lettering on a white background. The caption read, cryptically, “Excellences &amp; Perfections.” It received twenty-eight likes.</p>

				<p>For the next several months, she conducted a scripted online performance via her Instagram and Facebook profiles. As part of this project, titled Excellences and Perfections, Ulman underwent an extreme, semi-fictionalized makeover.</p>

				<p>She pretended to have a breast augmentation, posting images of herself in a hospital gown and with a bandaged chest, using a padded bra and Photoshop to manipulate her image. Other elements of the makeover were not feigned; she followed the Zao Dha Diet strictly, for example, and went to pole-dancing lessons often.</p>

				<p>Critic Brian Droitcour has described the rise of social media as a rebalancing of image-making power: the “aestheticization of everyday life in social media…has leeched the authority of image-making from mass media and from art.” In an important shift, social media has given far more people than ever before the means to self-publish.</p>
