				Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
				His house is in the village though;<br>
				He will not see me stopping here<br>
				To watch his woods fill up with snow.     
			</p>
			<p>
				My little horse must think it queer<br>
				To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
				Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
				The darkest evening of the year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
				To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
				The only other sound’s the sweep<br>
				Of easy wind and downy flake.   
			</p>
			<p>
				The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
				But I have promises to keep,<br>
				And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
				And miles to go before I sleep.

			<!-- Claude Mckay – Joy in the Woods -->
			<p>
				There is joy in the woods just now,<br>
				The leaves are whispers of song,<br>
				And the birds make mirth on the bough<br>
				And music the whole day long,<br>
				And God! to dwell in the town<br>
				In these springlike summer days,<br>
				On my brow an unfading frown<br>
				And hate in my heart always—
			</p>
			<p>
				A machine out of gear, aye, tired,<br>
				Yet forced to go on—for I’m hired.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just forced to go on through fear,<br>
				For every day I must eat<br>
				And find ugly clothes to wear,<br>
				And bad shoes to hurt my feet<br>
				And a shelter for work-drugged sleep!<br>
				A mere drudge! but what can one do?<br>
				A man that’s a man cannot weep!<br>
				Suicide? A quitter? Oh, no!<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				But a slave should never grow tired,<br>
				Whom the masters have kindly hired.
			</p>
			<p>
				But oh! for the woods, the flowers<br>
				Of natural, sweet perfume,<br>
				The heartening, summer showers<br>
				And the smiling shrubs in bloom,<br>
				Dust-free, dew-tinted at morn,<br>
				The fresh and life-giving air,<br>
				The billowing waves of corn<br>
				And the birds’ notes rich and clear:—
			</p>
			<p>
				For a man-machine toil-tired<br>
				May crave beauty too—though he’s hired.
